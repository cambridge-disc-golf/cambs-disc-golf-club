				<td>A dogleg right off the tee with a mando' tree on the right preventing cutting the corner.</td>

				<td>This hole brings the OB road on the left and low limbed trees on the right into play.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>10</td>
				<td>87</td>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>Start of back 9 on a flat hole with a fairway which is narrowed to 5 or 6m gap by a large patch of shrubbery left, and a tree on right.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>11</td>
				<td>73</td>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>A downhill hole with the basket located in the 'jail' copse of three small trees located centre/left in photo at the end of the fairway.</td>

			<tr>
				<td>12</td>
				<td>41</td>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>A short hole teeing from the grass for a few metres into a tunnel formed by shrubs and trees. The basket is off set left by a few metres at the end of the tunnel close to a felled pine tree.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>13</td>
				<td>53</td>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>The tunnel theme continues with a longer shot this time, before reaching a tunnel with a slightly wider gap than on the previous hole. The basket is visible from the tee on this one.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>14</td>
				<td>124</td>
				<td>4</td>
				<td>The last of 3 tunnel holes in a row is one of the hardest on the course. It begins in the tunnel and requires low, straight shots to cover the 95 or so metres to the end of the tunnel which opens up towards the exit. Anything left or right often leaves difficult shots back on to fairway with still a good distance to the hole. The basket is a further 30 ish metres on the grass in front, completely unobstructed.</td>

			<tr>
				<td>15</td>

				<td>3</td>
				<td>A slightly undulating hole rising from tee to the tree lined road.('river' OB)</td>
